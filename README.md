# MYOE - Mind Your Own Exercise 

My project used as step to be contracted by MYOB.






## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Overview
To be easy for you, we have both FRONTEND and BACKEND in the same repository.

In the backend we have our API connected to MongoDB
and in the frontend our React Dashboard conected at our API.

### Installing



Navigate to the backend folder and use the command

```
npm install && npm start
```

Navigate to the frontend folder and use the command

```
npm install && npm start
```

And you can access the dashboard through
http://localhost:3000/


## Built With

* React, Babel, Webpack 
* NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, 
* Visual Studio Code
* Hosted at Heroku

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags). 
t.## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file for details

## Assumptions

1. The total number of days in the month is not being considered.
2. I'm assuming that every month has 31 days =), this could be fixed using MomentJS latter.
3. I'm assuming the user will fill the data in the right format.







## Disclaimer

***is not a complete project ready for production, due to the time (only 3 days) i could not implement things like:

Backend:

1. JWT (Json Web Token)
2. Data validation
3. Deploy with docker
4. PM2
5. More tests

Frontend:

1. Login with WJT and Passport
2. State management
3. Toast pop-up notifications
4. Loading feedback
4. Filters
5. Error treatments
6. More tests
7. Styled Components
8. Payslip printing

I tried in the best way to make it clean, organized and only with a few modules.
I avoided many comments in the code because I think it is easy to understand, but if you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.
